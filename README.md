# Welcome to My Portfolio!

As an ex-accountant with a B.S. in Economics and Anthropology, I am passionate about consumer behavior and market research. I use tools like Python (Pandas) and SQL to perform data-driven analysis, including A/B testing, OLS regression, funnel analysis, and k-means clustering. I also have basic web development experience with Django for building online data collection tools. This portfolio is a showcase of my work and personal projects, highlighting my skills in converting complex data into actionable insights that help businesses make smarter decisions.
